# Nixie Divergence Meter Experiment

A thing I did for Kagaku Adventure fan blog (in ~2014-2016? not sure).

It is inspired by divergence meter in the Steins;Gate series.

In order for it to look properly you need some additional (proprietary) fonts:
* BO NX Tube (aka BONX) - it is a fan made S;G font specifically made to replicate Steins;Gate divergence meter. I think it was just licensed as creative commons (or unlicensed), but I'm not sure, so I didn't keep it in my repository. It is easily googlable tho
* Nixie (aka Nixie One) - this one is unnecessary, but nice to have as a fallback font
* Futurica - this one is unnecessary, but nice to have as a fallback font
